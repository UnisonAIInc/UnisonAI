```

### Using a Tool

thoughts: >
  The user wants current stock prices for Apple. I have a web search tool available that can retrieve this real-time financial information from reliable sources.

  query: "Apple AAPL current stock price today"
  num_results: 3
```

  result: "Based on my analysis, here are the findings: [detailed results here]..."
```

## Important Notes
- Never use speculative or imaginative reasoning
- Always validate your approach before executing
- If uncertain about parameters, ask for clarification
- Complete tasks thoroughly before using pass_result"""
