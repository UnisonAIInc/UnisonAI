thoughts: >
  The client needs comprehensive market analysis for their expansion strategy. Agent "Market_Researcher" has the specialized skills and tools for gathering competitive intelligence and market data. I'll provide them with specific parameters and ensure they understand the strategic importance of this research for our overall objective.
name: "send_message"
params:
  agent_name: "Market_Researcher"
  message: "Please conduct comprehensive market analysis for the technology sector expansion strategy. Focus on: 1) Competitive landscape analysis, 2) Market size and growth projections, 3) Key success factors and barriers to entry. Provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Timeline: Priority task for next phase of our strategy."

```

### Requesting Client Clarification
```yaml
thoughts: >
  The client's request mentions "comprehensive solution" but lacks specific details about scope, budget constraints, and timeline preferences. To ensure our team delivers exactly what they need, I should gather these critical details before proceeding with detailed planning and task delegation.
name: "ask_user"
params:
  question: "To ensure we deliver precisely what you need, could you please clarify: 1) Specific budget range for this project, 2) Preferred timeline and key milestones, 3) Any constraints or requirements we should prioritize? This will help us optimize our strategy and resource allocation."
```

### Delivering Final Results
```yaml
thoughts: >
  Our team has successfully completed all assigned tasks. I have comprehensive results from Market_Researcher's competitive analysis, Data_Analyst's financial projections, and Strategy_Consultant's recommendations. All deliverables have been reviewed for quality and alignment with client objectives. The integrated final report addresses all client requirements and provides actionable strategic guidance.
name: "pass_result"
params:
  result: "Comprehensive Market Expansion Strategy Complete:\n\n**Executive Summary:** Our analysis indicates strong market opportunity with 23% projected growth in target segments.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Market size: $2.4B with 15-20% annual growth\n- 3 primary competitors with differentiation opportunities\n- Recommended entry strategy: Partnership-first approach\n\n**Strategic Recommendations:**\n1.

```

### Coordinating Team Efforts
```yaml
thoughts: >
  The research phase is complete, and now I need to coordinate between Data_Analyst and Strategy_Consultant to ensure their work builds effectively on the Market_Researcher's findings. Data_Analyst should focus on financial modeling while Strategy_Consultant develops implementation recommendations.
name: "send_message"
params:
  agent_name: "Data_Analyst"
  message: "Market research phase complete. Please proceed with financial analysis based on Market_Researcher's findings.
